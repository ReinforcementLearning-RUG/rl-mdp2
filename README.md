## About
This repository contains skeleton code for the third assignment of the reinforcement learning course.
## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

## Running
<!--
-->

#### Setting up a virtual environment

You can also setup a virtual environment using Poetry. Poetry can  be installed using `pip`:
```
pip install poetry
```
Then initiate the virtual environment with the required dependencies (see `poetry.lock`, `pyproject.toml`):
```
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true    # ensures virtual environment is in project
poetry install
```
The virtual environment can be accessed from the shell using:
```
poetry shell
```
IDEs like Pycharm will be able to detect the interpreter of this virtual environment (after `Add new interpreter`). The interpreter that Pycharm should use is `./.venv/bin/python3.10`.

If you want to add dependencies to the project then you can simply do
```
poetry add <package_name>
```

#### Running the docker container

Instead of running locally you can also run the program inside a container using docker. A `docker-compose.yaml` file is provided which you can use to run the container using `docker compose up --build`.

## Usage

You can add unit tests if you like (not required) in the test folder. Please provide proper documentation and type hinting to any added code.

## Information on provided code

This repository contains some prefedined classes, see the `guide_mdp_class.ipynb` notebook for more information on how to use them.
